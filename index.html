      <h2>Proclamation to the Muslim Nation of Bengal</h2>
      <p>In the name of Allah — One, Supreme, and Indivisible — we declare the return of dignity, the revival of sovereignty, the resurrection of the Muslim Saltanat on the soil of Bengal.</p>

      <p>For too long, the Bengali Muslim — the second-largest Muslim nation on earth — has been enslaved under foreign ideologies, corrupt elites, and secular deception. Our identity has been erased. Our faith diluted. Our land turned into a testing ground for Western liberalism, U.N. puppetry, and cultural colonialism.</p>

      <p><strong>We say: ENOUGH.</strong></p>

      <p>We do not seek permission from kafir powers. We do not submit to U.S. interests or U.N. offices. We do not bow to man-made laws.</p>

      <p><strong>We bow only to Allah. We follow only His Sharia.</strong></p>

      <p>Let it be known:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔺 This land is Muslim.</li>
        <li>🔺 Its history is Sultanate.</li>
        <li>🔺 Its future is Muslimbongo.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The flag has been raised. The call has been made. From the madrasa to the masjid, from the village to the capital — We rise as one Ummah, one Nation, one Saltanat.</p>

      <p>🟩 Pro-Islam<br/>
      🟩 Pro-Desh<br/>
      🟩 Anti-Liberal, Anti-Imperialist</p>

      <p>This is the Revolution.<br/>
      This is #Muslimbongo.</p>

      <h2>Founding Manifesto</h2>

      <p>Muslimbongo – The Return of the Saltanat<br/>
      بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br/>
      In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>

      <p><strong>I. Our Oath</strong><br/>
      We are the inheritors of a lost empire.<br/>
      We are the sons of the Saltanat-e-Bangla (1338–1576), a sovereign Islamic kingdom that once stood tall in the heart of Bengal.<br/>
      We are Bengali Muslims — the second-largest Muslim nation on Earth.<br/>
      We refuse to be silent. We refuse to be ruled.<br/>
      We rise to reclaim, revive, and resurrect our destiny under the banner of Islam and Bangla.</p>

      <p><strong>II. Our Identity</strong><br/>
      We are Pro-Islamist: We believe the Qur'an and Sunnah are sufficient as constitution, judiciary, and law.<br/>
      We are Pro-Desh: Our nationalism is Islamic and Bengali — not borrowed from the West or contaminated by India.<br/>
      We are Revivalists: We seek to revive the political legacy of the Bengal Sultanate — just, independent, Islamic.<br/>
      We are Anti-Colonial: We reject U.S. imperialism, U.N. liberalism, Western-funded NGOs, and secular elite corruption.</p>

      <p><strong>III. Our Vision: MUSLIMBONGO</strong><br/>
      We do not call for another fragile democracy.<br/>
      We do not believe in secular liberal governance.<br/>
      We call for a Shariah-based State, an Islamic Sultanate, reborn in Bengal.<br/>
      We call this Muslimbongo —<br/>
      A sovereign Islamic republic for Bengali Muslims, founded on:<br/>
      Tawhid (Oneness of Allah)<br/>
      Shariah (Divine Law)<br/>
      Millat (Ummah Loyalty)<br/>
      Watan (Love of the Homeland)</p>

      <p><strong>IV. Our Enemies</strong><br/>
      The liberal colonial elite, trained to betray Islam for privilege<br/>
      The Western agents who spread secularism, feminism, LGBTQ+, and NGO-sponsored fitnah<br/>
      The Indian and globalist projects that seek to erase Muslim Bengali identity<br/>
      The UN and US-backed puppets who impose fake democracy to weaken our Imaan</p>

      <p><strong>V. Our Methods</strong><br/>
      Ideological warfare through media, literature, da’wah, and activism<br/>
      Youth awakening via Islamic education, digital resistance, and historical re-education<br/>
      Mobilization of Muslims to reject corrupt elections, reject man-made laws, and support Shariah revival<br/>
      Non-violent rebellion rooted in faith, loyalty, and divine legitimacy</p>

      <p><strong>VI. Our Call to the Ummah</strong><br/>
      Bengal is not just a land — it is a battlefield of ideas.<br/>
      We call on all Muslim students, workers, Ulama, youth, and mothers of the nation:<br/>
      Rise with us.<br/>
      Reclaim your faith.<br/>
      Reclaim your land.<br/>
      Reclaim your Sultanate.</p>

      <p><strong>VII. Declaration</strong><br/>
      We hereby declare the beginning of the Muslimbongo Movement.<br/>
      We pledge our lives, our strength, and our future to the revival of Banglah Saltanat under the banner of Islamic Fascism — not as oppression, but as divine order, justice, and unity.<br/>
      Let the flag rise.<br/>
      Let the believers gather.<br/>
      Let the Sultanate return.</p>
